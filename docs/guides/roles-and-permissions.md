# Roles and Permissions Guide

Complete guide to role-based access control (RBAC) in Rediver.

---

## Overview

Rediver uses a **role-based access control** system where:
- Each user belongs to one or more **Tenants** (Teams)
- Each membership has a **Role** that defines permissions
- Permissions control access to resources and actions

---

## Role Hierarchy

| Role | Priority | Description |
|------|:--------:|-------------|
| **Owner** | 4 | Full control including billing and team deletion |
| **Admin** | 3 | Full resource access + member management |
| **Member** | 2 | Create and edit resources, no delete/admin access |
| **Viewer** | 1 | Read-only access |

```
       ┌───────────┐
       │   Owner   │  ← Full control + billing
       └─────┬─────┘
             │
       ┌─────▼─────┐
       │   Admin   │  ← All resources + members
       └─────┬─────┘
             │
       ┌─────▼─────┐
       │  Member   │  ← Read + Write (no delete)
       └─────┬─────┘
             │
       ┌─────▼─────┐
       │  Viewer   │  ← Read only
       └───────────┘
```

## How Permissions Work

### 1. Token Generation

When a user exchanges their refresh token for a tenant-scoped access token, the role is mapped to permissions:

```go
// Access token includes permissions array
{
    "sub": "user-id",
    "tid": "tenant-id",
    "trole": "admin",
    "permissions": ["assets:read", "assets:write", "assets:delete", ...]
}
```

### 2. API Authorization

Each API endpoint requires specific permissions:

```go
// routes.go
r.Route("/assets", func(r chi.Router) {
    r.Use(middleware.RequireAuth)

    // Read endpoints
    r.With(middleware.Require("assets:read")).Get("/", h.List)
    r.With(middleware.Require("assets:read")).Get("/{id}", h.Get)

    // Write endpoints
    r.With(middleware.Require("assets:write")).Post("/", h.Create)
    r.With(middleware.Require("assets:write")).Put("/{id}", h.Update)

    // Delete endpoints
    r.With(middleware.Require("assets:delete")).Delete("/{id}", h.Delete)
})
```

### 3. Permission Check Flow

```
Request
   │
   ▼
Auth Middleware (validate JWT)
   │
   ▼
Extract permissions from token
   │
   ▼
Require(permission) Middleware
   │
   ├── Has permission? → Allow
   │
   └── Missing? → 403 Forbidden
```

## Common Role Assignments

| Role | Typical Members | Reason |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Owner | Team Lead, Security Lead | Billing, team management |
| Admin | Senior Developers | Full access, can manage tools |
| Member | Developers | Create findings, run scans |
| Viewer | Junior Developers | Learn, view findings |

### Security Operations

| Role | Typical Members | Reason |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| Owner | CISO, Security Director | Budget, team control |
| Admin | Security Engineers | Configure tools, manage workflows |

## Best Practices

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

Start with Viewer role and upgrade as needed.

### 2. Limit Owners

Have 2-3 owners maximum:
- Primary owner for day-to-day
- Backup owner for emergencies

### 3. Use Member for Developers

Developers typically need:
- Read all data ✅
- Create/edit findings ✅
- Run scans ✅
- Delete data ❌ (use Admin if needed)

### 4. Regular Access Reviews

- Review member list quarterly
- Remove inactive members
- Downgrade unused admin accounts

### 5. Document Role Assignments

Keep a record of why each person has their role level.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Permissions" Error

1. Check your current role: **Settings > Team Members**
2. Identify required permission from error message
3. Request role upgrade from Owner/Admin

### Can't Delete Resources

You need Admin or Owner role to delete. Contact team admin.

### Can't See Audit Logs

Audit logs require Admin or Owner role.

### Can't Access Billing

Only Owner can manage billing. Contact team owner.
